**Hybrid Caching with .NET 9 and Azure Cache for Redis**  
This repository demonstrates how to implement a hybrid caching strategy in .NET 9 using Azure Cache for Redis.  

The approach combines in-memory and distributed caching to boost performance, reduce database load, and support high-concurrency scenarios. It ensures fast data access, consistency, and scalability, promoting a clean, maintainable architecture for production-ready applications.
